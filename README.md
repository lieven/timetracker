# Time Tracker
Simple time tracker written for the first Showpad hackathon.

## About

Time Tracker is a simple status bar application for Mac OS X that helps you keep track of how you spent your day. The goal is to keep things as simple and generic as possible.

Time can be tracked for projects and tasks.
Using __projects__, you can get a global overview of your day. Using __tasks__, you can get a more detailed view of how your time on each project was spent.
