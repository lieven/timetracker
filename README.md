## About

Time Tracker is a simple status bar application for Mac OS X that helps you keep track of how you spent your day.

The goal is to keep things as simple and generic as possible. Time can be tracked for projects and tasks.
Using projects, you can get a global overview of your day. Using tasks, you can get a more detailed view of how your time on the project was spent.
